I have made lots of Projects and Lots of diferent Types of Coding like: 

a Cinema site using Bootstrap 4, many different Websites, using only Html, or in Combination with Css and JavaScript.

Then I have been using MySQL to automate an Library Data Site and a General School data Form. 

Right now Iam on C#. 

So far I've learned a lot about different methods and how to connect them together. 

My biggest Project so far, is a Black Jack Game, but it is still in developement.

With C# I created too an MVC that automates a Car Insurance Companys Quote Form.
